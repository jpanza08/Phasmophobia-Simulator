    Note: While this function is provided, you will likely want
    to modify it to suit your solution. This has been provided
    to give you a starting point to lay out the room connectivity,
    but it is entirely possible that you will want to use different
    data structures to represent the rooms and their connectivity,
    or different function names.

    Not following this function's structure exactly will not result
    in a deduction of points.
